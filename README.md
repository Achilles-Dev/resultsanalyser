## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- React.js
- Javascript

### Setup

1. Clone Repository
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:Achilles-Dev/resultsanalyser.git
   ```

### Install

1.  Run
    ```
    npm install
    ```

### Usage

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

2.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

3.  You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

4.  [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/ hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

5.  The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
